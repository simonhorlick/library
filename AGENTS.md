## Style

### Comments

Thorough code documentation with clear function comments and meaningful inline comments; consistent code spacing to separate logical blocks.

Comments should use full english sentences.

Comments in the body of the code are highly encouraged, but they should explain the intention of the code as opposed to just calling out the obvious.

Code should be organised into small functions that have a single responsibility. If a function is trying to do too much, it should be refactored into smaller functions.

Prefer `const foo = (a: A) => { ... }` over `function foo(a: A) { ... }` for defining functions.

After each change, create a commit. Commits should be small and focused on a single change. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes into a single commit.

For avoidance of doubt:
** MAKE MANY SMALL COMMITS **

## Model Git Commit Messages

Here’s a model Git commit message:

```
Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.
```

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

For short commits that need no explanation, the body can be omitted. For example
"backend: Refactor db -> database"

## Test driven development

Always practice red-green-refactor. Write failing tests. Commit them. Write code to make them pass. Commit that. Refactor. Commit that.
